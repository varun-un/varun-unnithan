                            The Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering, located at Morris Hills High School and part of the 
                            Morris County Vocational School District, is a rigorous, highly focused four year program for Morris County 
                            students with career interests in mathematics, science, or engineering. The program focuses on challenging 
                            students and preparing them to succeed in the field of STEM both in college and in their careers. In 2016, 
                            the Academy was ranked by <i>Newsweek</i> as the&nbsp;

                            I was accepted into the Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering after scoring highly on the entrance 
                            exam and interview, and have completed four years in the program. During these four years, 
                            I have maintained a weighted GPA of<b> 103.2</b>, on a 100-point scale, which translates to roughly a 
                            <b> 4.0 GPA</b> on a 4-point scale. My time in the program has taught me skills like problem solving and teamwork, 
                            while also preparing me with the necessary skills and knowledge to become a successful member in the field of 
                            STEM.

                            I have taken and completed the <i>ANU-ASTRO4x: Astrophysics: Cosmology</i> course on edX taught by Paul Francis 
                            and Brian Schmidt of the Australian National University. Through this course I gained a better understanding of 
                            Einsteinian physics and its applications on planetary and galactic motions. I also learned about other aspects
                            of astrophysics and cosmology, such as Hubble's Law, spacetime metrics, Friedmann equations, inflation theory, 
                            dark energy and the cosmic microwave background. Finally, I learned more about the technical skills used in 
                            cosmology, such as the tools and techniques used to measure distances and other values. This course not only 
                            furthered my knowledge about space and astrophysics, but has also made me even more excited to continue learning 
                            about the subject.

                            I have taken and completed the <i>Paradox and Infinity</i> course on edX taught by AgustÃ­n Rayo from MIT. 
                            This course modeled one typically offered to MIT students, and dives deeper into the theoretical aspects of 
                            mathematics, as well as its intersection with philosophy. Throughout the course, I gained a better understanding
                            of mathematical concepts such as higher infinities, cardinalities, probability, and the Banach-Tarski Paradox, 
                            while also getting to explore the limits of mathematics, which brought into question philosophical ideas
                            such as free will and the prisoner's dilemma. I also learned more about set theory, Godel's Theorem, and 
                            computability. Through this course I gained a better understanding of the extents to which mathematical 
                            concepts can be applied and further fueled my interest in mathematics.
