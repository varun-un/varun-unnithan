# varun-unnithan
The code for the portfolio website for myself, Varun Unnithan. The site can be found [here](https://www.varununnithan.com/ "varununnithan.com").

The goal of this site is to showcase not only my skills as a web developer, but also write about my abilities and the work I have done. The website is meant to serve as a centralized location for all information pertaining to me, that someone may want. 

This project also served as a learning experience for me, introducing me to many new technologies and tools. 

## Dependencies
### ReactJS
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is a Javascript library for building component-based UIs and single-page applications. I used React to build the entire website, so as to make the coding of the UI easier through components, as well as increasing the site's fluidity on use, as with React, each page loads immediately on a user's click. 

### React Router
[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is a library built on top of React in order to enable multi-page websites to exist within a React App's SPA format. Through React Router I was able to create a more 'natural' feeling website with multiple pages, while maintaining the benefits of React.

### React Transition Group
[React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) is a library that allows for smooth, CSS-based transitions between React components. I used this library in order to create a smooth fading transition between page switches in React Router.

### Babylon.js
[Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) is a 3D rendering engine and library based in Javascript and built on top of WebGL. I used Babylon.js in order to render 3D elements of the site, such as the model of my head and the contact section.

### GSAP
[GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), also known as the Greensock Animation Platform, is a Javascript library to create smooth animations for HTML elements and CSS classes. I not only used GSAP for this, but I also used ScrollTrigger, an extension of the GSAP library, in order to initiate these transitions based on the user's scroll position. This allowed me to make my website more engaging through animations.

## Build
This website was built and packaged using the [ParcelJS bundler](https://parceljs.org/), alongside [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile JSX scripts.
